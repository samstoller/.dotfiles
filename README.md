# .dotfiles
This repo contains my public dotfiles for *NIX machines and an accompanying Wiki that details my dotfile setup.

The goals of this project are to be able to **backup, restore, deploy and sync** a global set of dotfiles to any machine, and to allow indvidual hosts to add new dotfiles or override existing ones as needed.

If you are interested in cloning this repo, please see the [[Cloning This Repo]] page for details on how to integrate my dotfiles with yours.
